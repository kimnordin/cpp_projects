# CPP Repository

This repository contains a collection of small C++ projects, each showcasing different aspects of C++ programming. Below is an overview of each project.

## Projects

### [Hello World](https://github.com/kimnordin/cpp_projects/tree/master/hello_world)
This simple program prints "Hello World" to the console. It's a basic demonstration of a C++ program.

### [Pointer Dynamic Array](https://github.com/kimnordin/cpp_projects/tree/master/pointer_dynamic_array)
Illustrates the creation and usage of dynamic arrays in C++ using pointers. This project is useful for understanding dynamic memory management in C++.

- **Folder**: [pointer_dynamic_array](https://github.com/kimnordin/cpp_projects/tree/master/pointer_dynamic_array)

### [Pointer Swap](https://github.com/kimnordin/cpp_projects/tree/master/pointer_swap)
A simple demonstration of swapping two pointers in C++. It shows how to manipulate pointer values and the importance of understanding pointers in C++.

### [Rock Paper Scissor](https://github.com/kimnordin/cpp_projects/tree/master/rock_paper_scissor)
A terminal-based Rock Paper Scissors game that allows two users to play against each other. The program showcases basic C++ input/output and control structures.

### [Window](https://github.com/kimnordin/cpp_projects/tree/master/window)
Displays a window with the letters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. Each letter blinks in red, green, or blue when the corresponding 'R', 'G', or 'B' key is pressed on the keyboard. This project demonstrates basic graphical user interface (GUI) programming in C++.
